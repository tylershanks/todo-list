### What tools were used?

This project was created using Javascript, HTML, CSS, JSON, and webpack. 

### Why did you build this project?

This project was a part of The Odin Project's Fullstack Javascript curriculum. This project was created before any intros into React or any other Javascript libraries. Creating this with just vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS was definitely a challenge but it really helped me nail down a lot of primary concepts.

### Features
  - Create and delete different categories. 
  - Group different to-do's based on created categories.
  - View only the to-do's within a specified category.
  - Due dates can be added to individual to-do's.
  - Cross out to-do's when they are finished.
