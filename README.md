# todo-list

To-Do List project from The Odin Project.

This project was created using Javascript, HTML, CSS, JSON, and webpack. 

There are more features than just a basic to-do list. Some of these features include:
1) Create and delete different categories. 
2) Group different to-do's based on created categories.
3) View only the to-do's within a specified category.
4) Due dates can be added to individual to-do's.
5) Cross out to-do's when they are finished.

One feature that I would like to add one day is local storage. As of right now, the to-do's are lost when the page is closed or refreshed. Instead of adding it now, however, I am choosing to move ahead with The Odin Project to further my learning.
